## Basic of C# Game Engineering with Unity
This is my personal study log for learning the basics of the **C# language** and **game engineering with Unity.**

I'll be briefly covering the C# language, the Unity Engine, and general game engineering principles. 
Since it's been a long time since I've used Unity, I'll be starting from the very beginning and working through the fundamentals step-by-step.

### What I've Looked into So Far:
- Basic C#
  - Variable, Method, Class(Basic)
  - Array, List
  - for, foreach, while
  - Data Type, Call by Value, Call by Reference, GC
  - String Formats, DateTime
  - Nullable, Check Null, try catch, Property (get, set)
